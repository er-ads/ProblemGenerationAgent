"Example 6.1: A body of mass 400 g slides on a rough horizontal surface. If the frictional force is 3.0 N, find (a) the angle made by the contact force on the body with the vertical and (b) the magnitude of the contact force. Take g = 10 m/s^2. ","Let the contact force on the block by the surface be F which makes an angle theta with the vertical. The component of F perpendicular to the contact surface is the normal force N and the component of F parallel to the surface is the friction f. As the surface is horizontal, N is vertically upward. For vertical equilibrium, N = Mg = (0.400 kg)(10 m/s^2) = 4.0 N. The frictional force is f = 3.0 N. (a) tan theta = f / N = 3 / 4. theta = tan^-1(3/4) = 37 degrees. (b) The magnitude of the contact force is F = sqrt(N^2 + f^2) = sqrt((4.0 N)^2 + (3.0 N)^2) = 5.0 N.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 6.2: A heavy box of mass 20 kg is pulled on a horizontal surface by applying a horizontal force. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the horizontal surface is 0.25, find the force of friction exerted by the horizontal surface on the box. ","In the vertical direction there is no acceleration, so N = Mg. As the box slides on the horizontal surface, the surface exerts kinetic friction on the box. The magnitude of the kinetic friction is f_k = mu_k * N = mu_k * Mg = 0.25 * 20 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 49 N. This force acts in the direction opposite to the pull.","Friction","numerical_value"
"Example 6.3: A boy (30 kg) sitting on his horse whips it. The horse speeds up at an average acceleration of 2.0 m/s^2. (a) If the boy does not slide back, what is the force of friction exerted by the horse on the boy? (b) If the boy slides back during the acceleration, what can be said about the coefficient of static friction between the horse and the boy. Take g = 10 m/s^2. ","(a) The forces acting on the boy are the weight Mg, the normal contact force N, and the static friction f_s. As the boy does not slide back, its acceleration a is equal to the acceleration of the horse. As friction is the only horizontal force, it must act along the acceleration and its magnitude is given by Newton's second law: f_s = Ma = (30 kg)(2.0 m/s^2) = 60 N. (b) If the boy slides back, the horse could not exert a friction of 60 N on the boy. The maximum force of static friction that the horse may exert on the boy is f_s_max = mu_s * N = mu_s * Mg = mu_s * 30 kg * 10 m/s^2 = mu_s * 300 N. Thus, mu_s * 300 N < 60 N, or mu_s < 60/300 = 0.20.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 6.4: A wooden block is kept on a polished wooden plank and the inclination of the plank is gradually increased. It is found that the block starts slipping when the plank makes an angle of 18 degrees with the horizontal. However, once started the block can continue with uniform speed if the inclination is reduced to 15 degrees. Find the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the plank.","The coefficient of static friction is mu_s = tan(18 degrees). The coefficient of kinetic friction is mu_k = tan(15 degrees).","Friction","subjective_conceptual_short"
"Worked Out Example 1: The coefficient of static friction between a block of mass m and an incline is mu_s = 0.3. (a) What can be the maximum angle of the incline with the horizontal so that the block does not slip on the plane? (b) If the incline makes an angle theta/2 with the horizontal, find the frictional force on the block. ","(a) The forces on the block are weight mg downward, normal force N, and friction f up the plane. As the block is at rest, N = mg cos theta and f = mg sin theta. For limiting equilibrium, f = mu_s N. So mg sin theta = mu_s mg cos theta, which gives tan theta = mu_s. theta = tan^-1(0.3). (b) If the angle is theta/2, the equilibrium is not limiting. The force of static friction f balances the component of gravity parallel to the plane. f = mg sin(theta/2).","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 2: A horizontal force of 20 N is applied to a block of mass 4 kg resting on a rough horizontal table. If the block does not move on the table, how much frictional force the table is applying on the block? What can be said about the coefficient of static friction between the block and the table? Take g = 10 m/s^2. ","The forces on the block are: Weight 40 N downward, Normal force N upward, Applied force 20 N to the right, Friction f to the left. As the block is at rest, horizontal forces balance: f = 20 N. Thus, the table exerts a static frictional force of 20 N. Since the block is stationary, f <= mu_s N. 20 <= mu_s * 40. This implies mu_s >= 0.5.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 6: A block of mass 2.5 kg is kept on a rough horizontal surface. It is found that the block does not slide if a horizontal force less than 15 N is applied to it. Also it is found that it takes 5 seconds to slide through the first 10 m if a horizontal force of 15 N is applied and the block is gently pushed to start the motion. Taking g = 10 m/s^2, calculate the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the block and the surface. ","When F = 15 N is applied and block remains in limiting equilibrium, f_s_max = 15 N. f_s_max = mu_s * N = mu_s * Mg. mu_s = 15 / (2.5 * 10) = 0.60. When moving, kinetic friction acts. Displacement s = 10 m, time t = 5 s, initial velocity u = 0. s = 0.5 * a * t^2 gives 10 = 0.5 * a * 25, so a = 0.8 m/s^2. Newton's law: F - f_k = Ma. 15 - f_k = 2.5 * 0.8 = 2.0. f_k = 13 N. f_k = mu_k * N = mu_k * 25. mu_k = 13 / 25 = 0.52.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 7: A block placed on a horizontal surface is being pushed by a force F making an angle theta with the vertical. If the friction coefficient is mu, how much force is needed to get the block just started. Discuss the situation when tan theta < mu. ","For horizontal equilibrium, F sin theta = mu * N. For vertical equilibrium, N = F cos theta + mg. Substituting N, F sin theta = mu (F cos theta + mg). F (sin theta - mu cos theta) = mu mg. F = (mu mg) / (sin theta - mu cos theta). If tan theta < mu, then sin theta < mu cos theta, making the denominator negative. This implies infinite force is required; one cannot push the block ahead for such angles.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 8: Find the maximum value of M/m in the situation shown in figure 6-W11 so that the system remains at rest. Friction coefficient at both the contacts is mu. Discuss the situation when tan theta < mu. ","For block m on table: Tension T balances limiting friction mu * N1. N1 = mg. So T = mu * mg. For block M on incline: Components parallel to incline are T (up) and limiting friction f (up, to oppose downward tendency of M). Mg sin theta = T + f. Normal force on M is N2 = Mg cos theta. Friction f = mu * N2 = mu Mg cos theta. Substituting T: Mg sin theta = mu mg + mu Mg cos theta. Mg (sin theta - mu cos theta) = mu mg. M/m = mu / (sin theta - mu cos theta). If tan theta < mu, the denominator is negative, meaning the system will not slide for any value of M/m.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 9: Consider the situation shown in figure 6-W12. The horizontal surface below the bigger block C is smooth. The coefficient of friction between the blocks A and C is mu. Find the minimum and the maximum force F that can be applied in order to keep the smaller block A at rest with respect to the bigger block C. ","Assuming blocks move together with acceleration a = F / (M + 2m). For block A: Forces are Tension T, Friction f, Normal N. To prevent slipping, friction can be left or right. Case 1 (Min Force): A tends to slip right, friction f acts left. T - f = ma. Vertical equilibrium for B (moving horizontally with system? Diagram suggests B hangs. If B hangs and moves horizontally, string constraint is complex. Assuming B hangs inside a slot or similar). From solution context: Equation T + mu * ma = mg leads to a_min = g(1 - mu)/(1 + mu). Case 2 (Max Force): Friction acts right. T + f = ma leading to a_max = g(1 + mu)/(1 - mu). Force F ranges from (M+2m)a_min to (M+2m)a_max.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 10: Two blocks connected by a light string are placed on the two inclined parts of a triangular structure (angles 45 degrees). The coefficients of static and kinetic friction are 0.28 and 0.25 respectively at each surface. (a) Find the minimum and maximum values of m (other block is 2 kg) for which the system remains at rest. (b) Find the acceleration if m is given the minimum value and pushed gently. ","(a) Take 2 kg block (M). For minimum m, M tends to slip down. Friction on M is up incline. T = Mg sin 45 - f_M = Mg/sqrt(2) - mu_s Mg/sqrt(2). For block m, it tends to slip up? No, if m is small, it is pulled up. Friction on m is down incline. T = mg sin 45 + f_m = mg/sqrt(2) + mu_s mg/sqrt(2). Equating T: Mg(1 - mu_s) = mg(1 + mu_s). m = M (1 - 0.28)/(1 + 0.28) = 2 * 0.72 / 1.28 = 9/8 kg. For maximum m, directions reverse. m = M (1 + 0.28)/(1 - 0.28) = 32/9 kg. (b) With m = 9/8 kg and kinetic friction: Equations of motion M(g/sqrt(2)) - T - mu_k M(g/sqrt(2)) = Ma and T - m(g/sqrt(2)) - mu_k m(g/sqrt(2)) = ma. Adding gives a = [M(1 - mu_k) - m(1 + mu_k)]g / [sqrt(2)(M+m)]. Substituting values yields a = 0.31 m/s^2.","Friction","subjective_detailed_solution"
