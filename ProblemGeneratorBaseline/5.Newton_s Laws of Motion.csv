"Example 5.1: A heavy particle of mass 0.50 kg is hanging from a string fixed with the roof. Find the force exerted by the string on the particle (Figure 5.3). Take g = 9.8 m/s^2. (Description of Figure 5.3: A simple diagram showing a mass suspended vertically by a string from a fixed support.)","The forces acting on the particle are (a) pull of the earth, 0.50 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = 4.9 N vertically downward, and (b) pull of the string, T vertically upward. The particle is at rest with respect to the earth (which we assume to be an inertial frame). Hence, the sum of the forces should be zero. Therefore, T is 4.9 N acting vertically upward.","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 5.2: A block of mass M is pulled on a smooth horizontal table by a string making an angle theta with the horizontal as shown in figure 5.7. If the acceleration of the block is a, find the force applied by the string and by the table on the block. (Description of Figure 5.7: A block M rests on a horizontal surface. A string pulls it to the right and upwards at an angle theta to the horizontal. A person is shown holding the string.)","Let us consider the block as the system. The forces on the block are (a) pull of the earth, Mg, vertically downward, (b) contact force by the table, N, vertically upward, (c) pull of the string, T, along the string. The free body diagram is shown in figure 5.8. The acceleration of the block is horizontal and towards the right. Take this direction as the X-axis and vertically upward direction as the Y-axis. Component of Mg along X-axis = 0. Component of N along X-axis = 0. Component of T along X-axis = T cos(theta). Hence the total force along X-axis = T cos(theta). Using Newton's law, T cos(theta) = Ma. Component of Mg along Y-axis = -Mg. Component of N along Y-axis = N. Component of T along Y-axis = T sin(theta). Total force along Y-axis = N + T sin(theta) - Mg. Using Newton's law, N + T sin(theta) - Mg = 0. From equation (i), T = Ma / cos(theta). Putting this in equation (ii) N = Mg - Ma tan(theta).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 5.3: The mass of the part of the string below A in figure 5.9 is m. Find the tension of the string at the lower end and at A. (Description of Figure 5.9: A heavy block of mass M hangs from a thick vertical string. Point A is a specific point on the string above the block.)","To get the tension at the lower end we need the force exerted by the string on the block. Take the block as the system. The forces on it are (a) pull of the string, T, upward, (b) pull of the earth, Mg, downward. As the acceleration of the block is zero, these forces should add to zero. Hence the tension at the lower end is T = Mg. To get the tension T' at A we need the force exerted by the upper part of the string on the lower part of the string. For this we may write the equation of motion for the lower part of the string. So take the string below A as the system. The forces acting on this part are (a) T', upward, by the upper part of the string, (b) mg, downward, by the earth, (c) T, downward, by the block. As the system under consideration (the lower part of the string) is in equilibrium, Newton's first law gives T' = T + mg. But T = Mg hence, T' = (M + m)g.","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 5.4: The block shown in figure 5.11 has a mass M and descends with an acceleration a. The mass of the string below the point A is m. Find the tension of the string at the point A and at the lower end. (Description of Figure 5.11: A block M hanging from a string. A person is holding the string. Point A is marked on the string above the block. The system is accelerating downwards.)","Consider the block + the part of the string below A as the system. Let the tension at A be T. The forces acting on this system are (a) (M + m)g downward, by the earth, (b) T, upward, by the upper part of the string. The system is descending with an acceleration a. Taking the downward direction as the X-axis, the total force along the X-axis is (M + m)g - T. Using Newton's law (M + m)g - T = (M + m)a. or, T = (M + m)(g - a). To get the tension T' at the lower end we can put m = 0. Effectively, we take the point A at the lower end. Thus, we get T' = M(g - a).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 5.5: A pendulum is hanging from the ceiling of a car having an acceleration a0 with respect to the road. Find the angle made by the string with the vertical. (Description of Figure 5.14: A simple pendulum hangs inside a car. The car accelerates forward with a0. The pendulum swings backward, making an angle theta with the vertical.)","Suppose the mass of the bob is m and the string makes an angle theta with the vertical. We shall work from the car frame. This frame is noninertial as it has an acceleration a0 with respect to an inertial frame (the road). Hence, if we use Newton's second law we shall have to include a pseudo force. Take the bob as the system. The forces are: (a) T along the string, by the string, (b) mg downward, by the earth, (c) m*a0 towards left (pseudo force). As the bob is at rest (relative to the car) the forces in (a), (b) and (c) should add to zero. Take X-axis along the forward horizontal direction and Y-axis along the upward vertical direction. The components of the forces along the X-axis give T sin(theta) - m*a0 = 0 or, T sin(theta) = m*a0. The components along the Y-axis give T cos(theta) - mg = 0 or, T cos(theta) = mg. Dividing the first equation by the second, tan(theta) = a0/g. Thus, the string makes an angle tan^-1(a0/g) with the vertical.","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 1: A body of mass m is suspended by two strings making angles alpha and beta with the horizontal. Find the tensions in the strings. (Description of Figure 5-W1: A mass m is suspended from a ceiling by two strings forming a 'V' shape. The left string makes angle alpha with the ceiling, the right string makes angle beta.)","Take the body of mass m as the system. The forces acting on the system are (i) mg downwards (by the earth), (ii) T1 along the first string (by the first string) and (iii) T2 along the second string (by the second string). As the body is in equilibrium, these forces must add to zero. Taking horizontal components, T1 cos(alpha) - T2 cos(beta) + mg cos(90) = 0 or, T1 cos(alpha) = T2 cos(beta). Taking vertical components, T1 sin(alpha) + T2 sin(beta) - mg = 0. Eliminating T2 from the equations: T1 sin(alpha) + T1 (cos(alpha)/cos(beta)) sin(beta) = mg. T1 = mg / (sin(alpha) + (cos(alpha)/cos(beta))sin(beta)) = (mg cos(beta)) / sin(alpha + beta). Similarly, T2 = (mg cos(alpha)) / sin(alpha + beta).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 2: Two bodies of masses m1 and m2 are connected by a light string going over a smooth light pulley at the end of an incline. The mass m1 lies on the incline and m2 hangs vertically. The system is at rest. Find the angle of the incline and the force exerted by the incline on the body of mass m1. (Description of Figure 5-W2: A triangular wedge (incline) with angle theta. Mass m1 rests on the incline. A string connects m1 over a pulley at the top vertex to a mass m2 hanging vertically on the vertical side.)","Take the body of mass m2 as the system. The forces acting on it are (i) m2g vertically downward, (ii) T vertically upward. As the system is at rest, T = m2g. Next, consider the body of mass m1 as the system. The forces are (i) m1g vertically downward, (ii) T along the string up the incline, (iii) N normal to the incline. Taking components parallel to the incline: T = m1g sin(theta). Taking components along the normal to the incline: N = m1g cos(theta). Eliminating T from the first two equations: m2g = m1g sin(theta) giving sin(theta) = m2/m1, so theta = sin^-1(m2/m1). From the normal force equation, N = m1g sqrt(1 - (m2/m1)^2).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 3: A bullet moving at 250 m/s penetrates 5 cm into a tree limb before coming to rest. Assuming that the force exerted by the tree limb is uniform, find its magnitude. Mass of the bullet is 10 g.","The tree limb exerts a force on the bullet in the direction opposite to its velocity. This force causes deceleration. u = 250 m/s, v = 0, x = 5 cm = 0.05 m. Using v^2 = u^2 + 2ax, 0 = (250 m/s)^2 + 2a(0.05 m). giving, a = -(250 m/s)^2 / (2 * 0.05 m) = -625000 m/s^2. Magnitude is 625000 m/s^2. The force on the bullet is F = ma = (0.01 kg)(625000 m/s^2) = 6250 N.","Newton's Laws of Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 4: The force on a particle of mass 10 g is (10i + 5j) N. If it starts from rest what would be its position at time t = 5 s?","We have Fx = 10 N giving ax = Fx/m = 10 N / 0.01 kg = 1000 m/s^2. As this is a case of constant acceleration in x-direction, x = ux*t + (1/2)ax*t^2 = 0 + (1/2)(1000 m/s^2)(5 s)^2 = 12500 m. Similarly, ay = Fy/m = 5 N / 0.01 kg = 500 m/s^2. y = (1/2)(500 m/s^2)(5 s)^2 = 6250 m. Thus, the position of the particle at t = 5 s is r = (12500i + 6250j) m.","Newton's Laws of Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 5: With what acceleration 'a' should the box of figure 5-W4 descend so that the block of mass M exerts a force Mg/4 on the floor of the box? (Description of Figure 5-W4: A box/elevator containing a block M on its floor. The box is accelerating to the right with a0 (Note: The text description says descend, likely a vertical acceleration 'a').)","The block is at rest with respect to the box which is accelerated with respect to the ground. Hence, the acceleration of the block with respect to the ground is 'a' downward. The forces on the block are (i) Mg downward (by the earth) and (ii) N upward (by the floor). The equation of motion of the block is Mg - N = Ma. If N = Mg/4, the above equation gives Mg - Mg/4 = Ma. a = 3g/4. The block and hence the box should descend with an acceleration 3g/4.","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 6: A block 'A' of mass m is tied to a fixed point C on a horizontal table through a string passing round a massless smooth pulley B (figure 5-W5). A force F is applied by the experimenter to the pulley. Show that if the pulley is displaced by a distance x, the block will be displaced by 2x. Find the acceleration of the block and the pulley. (Description of Figure 5-W5: A block m on a table connected to a fixed point C via a movable pulley B. A string goes from C, around B, to the block A. Force F pulls pulley B away from the wall.)","Suppose the pulley is displaced to B' and the block to A'. The length of the string is constant. From geometry, displacement of A is twice the displacement of B (AA' = 2BB'). Differentiating twice, the acceleration of A is twice the acceleration of B. To find the acceleration of the block we need the tension. Consider the pulley as the system. Forces: F right, T left (top string), T left (bottom string). Mass of pulley is zero, so F - 2T = 0, giving T = F/2. Now consider the block. Only horizontal force is T towards right. Acceleration of block a = T/m = F/(2m). Acceleration of pulley = a/2 = F/(4m).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 7: A smooth ring A of mass m can slide on a fixed horizontal rod. A string tied to the ring passes over a fixed pulley B and carries a block C of mass M (= 2m) as shown in figure 5-W7. At an instant the string between the ring and the pulley makes an angle theta with the rod. (a) Show that, if the ring slides with a speed v, the block descends with speed v cos theta. (b) With what acceleration will the ring start moving if the system is released from rest with theta = 30 degrees? (Description of Figure 5-W7: A ring A on a horizontal rod. A string connects A to a pulley B located below the rod, and then down to a hanging mass C. The angle between the rod and string AB is theta.)","(a) Let ring move A to A' and block C to C' in time dt. From geometry (length conservation), change in length of hypotenuse equals displacement of block. AA' cos(theta) = CC'. Dividing by dt, velocity of block = v cos(theta). (b) Initial acceleration relation: a_block = a_ring cos(theta). Let T be tension. Block equation: Mg - T = M(a_ring cos(theta)). Ring equation along rod: T cos(theta) = m(a_ring). Substitute T = m a_ring / cos(theta) into block equation: Mg - m a_ring / cos(theta) = M a_ring cos(theta). With M=2m and theta=30 deg: 2mg - m a_ring / (sqrt(3)/2) = 2m a_ring (sqrt(3)/2). 2g = a_ring (2/sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)). 2g = a_ring (5/sqrt(3)). a_ring = 2*sqrt(3)*g / 5 = 6.78 m/s^2.","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 8: A light rope fixed at one end of a wooden clamp on the ground passes over a tree branch and hangs on the other side. It makes an angle of 30 degrees with the ground. A man weighing (60 kg) wants to climb up the rope. The wooden clamp can come out of the ground if an upward force greater than 360 N is applied to it. Find the maximum acceleration in the upward direction with which the man can climb safely. Neglect friction at the tree branch. Take g = 10 m/s^2. (Description of Figure 5-W9: A rope anchored to the ground at angle 30 degrees, going over a branch. A man hangs from the vertical part.)","Let T be tension. Upward force on clamp is T sin(30) = T/2. Max tension before clamp fails: T/2 = 360 N -> T = 720 N. Equation of motion for man (mass 60 kg): T - mg = ma. 720 - 600 = 60a. 120 = 60a. a = 2 m/s^2.","Newton's Laws of Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 9: Three blocks of masses m1, m2 and m3 are connected as shown in the figure 5-W10. All the surfaces are frictionless and the string and the pulleys are light. Find the acceleration of m1. (Description of Figure 5-W10: Mass m1 sits on a horizontal table, connected by a string over a fixed pulley A to a movable pulley B. Masses m2 and m3 hang from pulley B via another string.)","Acceleration of m1 is a0 (right). Downward acceleration of pulley B is a0. Acceleration of m2 relative to B is a (up), m3 relative to B is a (down). Absolute acceleration of m2 = a0 - a (down). Absolute acceleration of m3 = a0 + a (down). Forces on Pulley B (mass 0): T upward, 2T' downward. T = 2T' -> T' = T/2. Motion of m1: T = m1*a0. Motion of m2: m2g - T' = m2(a0 - a). Motion of m3: m3g - T' = m3(a0 + a). Substitute T' = m1*a0/2 into m2 and m3 equations. m2g - m1a0/2 = m2(a0 - a). m3g - m1a0/2 = m3(a0 + a). Solving this system for a0 gives a0 = g / [1 + (m1/4)(1/m2 + 1/m3)].","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 10: A particle slides down a smooth inclined plane of elevation theta, fixed in an elevator going up with an acceleration a0. The base of the incline has a length L. Find the time taken by the particle to reach the bottom. (Description of Figure 5-W12: An elevator accelerating upward with a0. Inside, a wedge with angle theta and base L. A block slides down the wedge.)","Work in the elevator frame (non-inertial). Pseudo force m*a0 downward. Total effective downward force m(g + a0). Component parallel to incline: m(g + a0)sin(theta). Acceleration relative to incline a = (g + a0)sin(theta). Distance to cover s = L / cos(theta). Using s = (1/2)at^2: L/cos(theta) = (1/2)(g + a0)sin(theta) t^2. t = sqrt( 2L / ((g + a0)sin(theta)cos(theta)) ).","Newton's Laws of Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 11: All the surfaces shown in figure 5-W14 are assumed to be frictionless. The block of mass m slides on the prism which in turn slides backward on the horizontal surface. Find the acceleration of the smaller block with respect to the prism. (Description of Figure 5-W14: A small block m on a prism M. Prism M is on a flat surface. M slides left, m slides down M.)","Let acceleration of prism be a0 backward. Work in prism frame (non-inertial). Pseudo force on block: m*a0 forward (right). Forces on block: N, mg, m*a0. Equation parallel to incline: m*a0 cos(theta) + mg sin(theta) = m*a_rel (where a_rel is acceleration of block wrt prism). Equation perpendicular to incline: N + m*a0 sin(theta) = mg cos(theta). Now considering prism in lab frame: Vertical forces balance. Horizontal force is N sin(theta) backward. N sin(theta) = M*a0. Eliminate N and a0 to find a_rel.
