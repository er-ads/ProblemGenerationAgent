"Example 10.3: A bucket is being lowered down into a well through a rope passing over a fixed pulley of radius 10 cm. Assume that the rope does not slip on the pulley. Find the angular velocity and angular acceleration of the pulley at an instant when the bucket is going down at a speed of 20 cm/s and has an acceleration of 4.0 m/s^2.","Since the rope does not slip on the pulley, the linear speed v of the rim of the pulley is same as the speed of the bucket. The angular velocity of the pulley is then w = v/r = 20 cm/s / 10 cm = 2 rad/s. The angular acceleration of the pulley is alpha = a/r = 4.0 m/s^2 / 10 cm = 400 cm/s^2 / 10 cm = 40 rad/s^2.","Rigid Body Dynamics","numerical_value"
"Example 10.4: Consider a pulley fixed at its centre of mass by a clamp. A light rope is wound over it and the free end is tied to a block. The tension in the rope is T. (a) Write the forces acting on the pulley. How are they related? (b) Locate the axis of rotation. (c) Find the torque of the forces about the axis of rotation. ","(a) The forces on the pulley are (i) attraction by the earth, Mg vertically downward, (ii) tension T by the rope, along the rope, (iii) contact force N by the support at the centre. N = T + Mg (centre of mass of the pulley is at rest). (b) The axis of rotation is the line through the centre of the pulley and perpendicular to the plane of the pulley. (c) The force Mg passes through the centre of mass and it intersects the axis of rotation. Hence the torque of Mg about the axis is zero. Similarly, the torque of the contact force N is also zero. The tension T is along the tangent of the rim in the vertically downward direction. The torque is T*r (positive, assuming anticlockwise rotation).","Rigid Body Dynamics","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 10.5: A wheel of radius 10 cm can rotate freely about its centre. A string is wrapped over its rim and is pulled by a force of 5.0 N. It is found that the torque produces an angular acceleration 2.0 rad/s^2 in the wheel. Calculate the moment of inertia of the wheel. ","The forces acting on the wheel are (i) W due to gravity, (ii) N due to the support at the centre and (iii) F due to tension. The torque of W and N are separately zero and that of F is F*r. The net torque is Torque = (5.0 N)*(10 cm) = 0.50 N-m. The moment of inertia is I = Torque / alpha = 0.50 N-m / 2.0 rad/s^2 = 0.25 kg-m^2.","Rigid Body Dynamics","numerical_value"
"Example 10.6: A wheel is rotating at an angular speed w about its axis which is kept vertical. An identical wheel initially at rest is gently dropped into the same axle and the two wheels start rotating with a common angular speed. Find this common angular speed.","Let the moment of inertia of the wheel about the axis be I. Take both the wheels together as the system. The total angular momentum of the system before the coupling is I*w + 0 = I*w. When the second wheel is dropped into the axle, no external torque is applied on the two-wheel system and hence the angular momentum of the system remains unchanged. If the common angular speed is w', the total angular momentum of the two-wheel system is 2I*w' after the coupling. Thus, I*w = 2I*w', giving w' = w/2.","Rigid Body Dynamics","numerical_value"
"Example 10.7: A wheel of moment of inertia I and radius r is free to rotate about its centre. A string is wrapped over its rim and a block of mass m is attached to the free end of the string. The system is released from rest. Find the speed of the block as it descends through a height h. ","Let the speed of the block be v when it descends through a height h. This is the speed of the string and hence of a particle at the rim of the wheel. The angular velocity of the wheel is v/r and its kinetic energy at this instant is 0.5*I*(v/r)^2. Using the principle of conservation of energy, the gravitational potential energy lost by the block must be equal to the kinetic energy gained by the block and the wheel. Thus, mgh = 0.5*m*v^2 + 0.5*I*(v/r)^2. Solving for v, we get v = [2mgh / (m + I/r^2)]^0.5.","Rigid Body Dynamics","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 10.8: Consider a light rod with two heavy mass particles at its ends. Let AB be a line perpendicular to the rod as shown in the figure. What is the moment of inertia of the system about AB? ","Moment of inertia of the particle on the left is m1*r1^2. Moment of inertia of the particle on the right is m2*r2^2. Moment of inertia of the rod is negligible as the rod is light. Thus, the moment of inertia of the system about AB is m1*r1^2 + m2*r2^2.","Rigid Body Dynamics","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 10.9: Three particles, each of mass m, are situated at the vertices of an equilateral triangle ABC of side L. Find the moment of inertia of the system about the line AX perpendicular to AB in the plane of ABC. ","Perpendicular distance of A from AX = 0. Perpendicular distance of B from AX = L. Perpendicular distance of C from AX = L/2 (since C is at horizontal distance L/2 from A). Thus, the moment of inertia of the particle at A = 0, of the particle at B = m*L^2, and of the particle at C = m*(L/2)^2. The moment of inertia of the three-particle system about AX is 0 + m*L^2 + m*(L/2)^2 = 5mL^2/4.","Rigid Body Dynamics","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 10.10: Find the moment of inertia of a uniform ring of mass M and radius R about a diameter. ","Let AB and CD be two mutually perpendicular diameters of the ring. Take them as X and Y-axes and the line perpendicular to the plane of the ring through the centre as the Z-axis. The moment of inertia of the ring about the Z-axis is Iz = MR^2. As the ring is uniform, all of its diameters are equivalent and so Ix = Iy. From perpendicular axes theorem, Iz = Ix + Iy. Hence Ix = Iz / 2 = MR^2 / 2.","Rigid Body Dynamics","subjective_conceptual_short"
"Example 10.11: Find the moment of inertia of a solid cylinder of mass M and radius R about a line parallel to the axis of the cylinder and on the surface of the cylinder.","The moment of inertia of the cylinder about its axis = MR^2 / 2.

"Worked Out Example 1: A wheel rotates with a constant acceleration of 2.0 rad/s^2. If the wheel starts from rest, how many revolutions will it make in the first 10 seconds?","The angular displacement in the first 10 seconds is given by theta = w0*t + 0.5*alpha*t^2 = 0.5 * 2.0 * 10^2 = 100 rad. As the wheel turns by 2pi radian in each revolution, the number of revolutions in 10 s is n = 100 / 2pi = 16.","Rigid Body Dynamics","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 2: The wheel of a motor, accelerated uniformly from rest, rotates through 2.5 radian during the first second. Find the angle rotated during the next second.","As the angular acceleration is constant, we have theta = 0.5*alpha*t^2. Thus, 2.5 rad = 0.5*alpha*(1 s)^2, which gives alpha = 5 rad/s^2. The angle rotated during the first two seconds is 0.5 * 5 * (2)^2 = 10 rad. Thus, the angle rotated during the 2nd second is 10 rad - 2.5 rad = 7.5 rad.","Rigid Body Dynamics","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 3: A wheel having moment of inertia 2 kg-m^2 about its axis, rotates at 50 rpm about this axis.

The string is now pulled by a force of 20 N. Find the angular velocity of the wheel after 5.0 seconds.","The torque applied to the wheel is Torque = F*r = (20 N)(0.20 m) = 4.0 N-m. The angular acceleration produced is alpha = Torque / I = 4.0 / 0.20 = 20 rad/s^2.

A string is wrapped round the wheel and its free end supports a block of mass M which can slide on the plane. Initially, the wheel is rotating at a speed w in a direction such that the block slides up the plane. How far will the block move before stopping? ","Suppose the deceleration of the block is a. The angular deceleration of the wheel is alpha = a/r. Equations of motion: Mg sin theta - T = Ma and T*r = I*alpha = I(a/r). Eliminating T, we get a = (Mg r^2 sin theta) / (I + Mr^2).
