    "problem_text": "In an industrial setting, a 20 kg crate is dropped from a height and impacts a stationary section of a conveyor belt at a speed of 5 m/s. The crate immediately sticks to the belt. This conveyor belt section, which has a mass of 100 kg, is mechanically linked to a 80 kg counterweight by a cable and pulley system, ensuring they move together. What is the speed of the conveyor belt and counterweight system immediately after the crate sticks?",

    "problem_text": "A car of mass 1500 kg is traveling at 10 m/s when it rear-ends a stationary car of mass 1200 kg. The stationary car is towing a 300 kg trailer. All three vehicles become entangled and move as a single unit immediately after the perfectly inelastic collision. What is the speed of the combined wreckage just after the impact?",

    "problem_text": "During a physics demonstration, a tennis ball of mass 0.06 kg is launched horizontally at 30 m/s into a complex target. The target consists of two laboratory carts, cart A (mass 2 kg) and cart B (mass 1 kg), initially at rest on a frictionless track and connected by a light, rigid rod. The tennis ball embeds itself in cart A upon impact. What is the speed of the combined three-body system (ball + cart A + cart B) immediately after the collision?",

    "problem_text": "A high-speed projectile of mass 0.01 kg is fired horizontally at 100 m/s into a stationary wooden block of mass 0.5 kg. This block is connected by a compressed spring to an identical second wooden block of mass 0.5 kg, both resting on a frictionless surface. The projectile embeds itself in the first block. Assuming the spring's internal forces are negligible during the instantaneous collision, calculate the speed of the combined two-block and projectile system just after the projectile strikes.",
