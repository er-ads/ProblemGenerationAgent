"Example 9.1: Four particles A, B, C and D having masses m, 2m, 3m and 4m respectively are placed in order at the corners of a square of side a. Locate the centre of mass. (Description of Figure 9.3: A square in the X-Y plane. Particle A (mass m) is at the origin (0,0). Particle B (mass 2m) is at (a, 0). Particle C (mass 3m) is at (a, a). Particle D (mass 4m) is at (0, a).)","Take the axes as shown in the figure. The coordinates of the four particles are: A(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,a), D(0,a). Hence, the coordinates of the centre of mass of the four-particle system are: X = (m*0 + 2m*a + 3m*a + 4m*0) / (m + 2m + 3m + 4m) = 5ma / 10m = a/2. Y = (m*0 + 2m*0 + 3m*a + 4m*a) / (m + 2m + 3m + 4m) = 7ma / 10m = 7a/10. The centre of mass is at (a/2, 7a/10).","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 9.3: Two charged particles of masses m and 2m are placed a distance d apart on a smooth horizontal table. Because of their mutual attraction, they move towards each other and collide. Where will the collision occur with respect to the initial positions?","As the table is smooth, there is no friction. The weight of the particles and the normal force balance each other. Taking the two particles as the system, the sum of external forces is zero (attraction is internal). Therefore, the centre of mass has no acceleration. Initially velocities are zero, so COM velocity is zero. The COM remains at the same place. Collision occurs at the COM. Location of COM from mass m is: x_cm = (m*0 + 2m*d) / (m + 2m) = 2d/3. The collision will take place at a distance 2d/3 from the initial position of mass m.","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 9.4: Each of the blocks shown in figure 9.14 has mass 1 kg. The rear block moves with a speed of 2 m/s towards the front block kept at rest. The spring attached to the front block is light and has a spring constant 50 N/m. Find the maximum compression of the spring. (Description of Figure 9.14: Two blocks on a frictionless surface. The left block moves right with velocity v. The right block is stationary and has a spring attached to its left side.)","Maximum compression occurs when blocks move with equal velocity V. No net external force, so momentum is conserved: (1 kg)(2 m/s) = (1 kg)V + (1 kg)V. This gives 2 = 2V, so V = 1 m/s. Initial Kinetic Energy = (1/2)(1)(2)^2 = 2 J. Final Kinetic Energy (at max compression) = (1/2)(1)(1)^2 + (1/2)(1)(1)^2 = 1 J. The lost KE is stored as elastic potential energy: (1/2)kx^2 = Initial KE - Final KE. (1/2)(50)x^2 = 2 - 1 = 1. 25x^2 = 1. x = 0.2 m.","Centre of Mass","numerical_value"
"Example 9.5: A cart A of mass 50 kg moving at a speed of 20 km/h hits a lighter cart B of mass 20 kg moving towards it at a speed of 10 km/h. The two carts cling to each other. Find the speed of the combined mass after the collision.","This is an inelastic collision. Momenta have opposite signs. Let V be the common speed. Momentum conservation: (50 kg)(20 km/h) - (20 kg)(10 km/h) = (50 + 20)V. 1000 - 200 = 70V. 800 = 70V. V = 80/7 km/h.","Centre of Mass","numerical_value"
"Example 9.6: A block of mass m moving at speed v collides with another block of mass 2m at rest. The lighter block comes to rest after the collision. Find the coefficient of restitution.","Suppose the second block (2m) moves at speed v' after collision. Conservation of momentum: mv = 2mv', so v' = v/2. Velocity of separation = v' - 0 = v/2. Velocity of approach = v - 0 = v. Coefficient of restitution e = (velocity of separation)/(velocity of approach) = (v/2) / v = 1/2.","Centre of Mass","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 1: Three particles of masses 0.50 kg, 1.0 kg and 1.5 kg are placed at the three corners of a right-angled triangle of sides 3.0 cm, 4.0 cm and 5.0 cm as shown in figure 9-W1. Locate the centre of mass of the system. (Description of Figure 9-W1: A right-angled triangle. The particle of 0.50 kg is at the right-angle vertex. The 4.0 cm side lies along the horizontal (X-axis) connecting to the 1.0 kg mass. The 3.0 cm side lies along the vertical (Y-axis) connecting to the 1.5 kg mass.)","Let the 4.0 cm line be the X-axis and the 3.0 cm line be the Y-axis. Coordinates: 0.50 kg at (0,0); 1.0 kg at (4.0, 0); 1.5 kg at (0, 3.0). X_cm = (0.50*0 + 1.0*4.0 + 1.5*0) / (0.50 + 1.0 + 1.5) = 4.0 / 3.0 = 1.3 cm. Y_cm = (0.50*0 + 1.0*0 + 1.5*3.0) / (3.0) = 4.5 / 3.0 = 1.5 cm. The centre of mass is 1.3 cm right and 1.5 cm above the 0.5 kg particle.","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 2: Half of the rectangular plate shown in figure 9-W2 is made of a material of density rho1 and the other half of density rho2. The length of the plate is L. Locate the centre of mass of the plate. (Description of Figure 9-W2: A rectangular plate of length L divided vertically into two equal halves. Left half has density rho1, right half has density rho2. Origin O is at the middle of the left edge.)","The centre of mass of each half is at its geometric centre. Left half (mass proportional to rho1) is at x = L/4. Right half (mass proportional to rho2) is at x = 3L/4. Mass is proportional to density since volume is same. Let mass factors be K*rho1 and K*rho2. X_cm = (K*rho1 * L/4 + K*rho2 * 3L/4) / (K*rho1 + K*rho2). X_cm = (rho1 + 3*rho2)L / 4(rho1 + rho2).","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 3: The density of a linear rod of length L varies as rho = A + Bx where x is the distance from the left end. Locate the centre of mass.","Mass element dm = rho * area * dx = (A + Bx) * alpha * dx. X_cm = Integral(x dm) / Integral(dm) from 0 to L. Numerator = Integral(Ax + Bx^2)dx = A(L^2/2) + B(L^3/3). Denominator = Integral(A + Bx)dx = AL + B(L^2/2). X_cm = (AL^2/2 + BL^3/3) / (AL + BL^2/2) = (3AL + 2BL^2) / (3(2A + BL)).","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 4: A cubical block of ice of mass m and edge L is placed in a large tray of mass M. If the ice melts, how far does the centre of mass of the system 'ice plus tray' come down? (Description of Figure 9-W4: A block of ice on a tray. x1 is height of tray COM, x2 is height of ice COM.)","Let tray COM be at height x1. Ice COM is at x2 = L/2 (assuming base on tray surface). Initial COM height x = (m*x2 + M*x1)/(m+M). When ice melts, water spreads on tray, its COM is effectively on the surface (height negligible, approx 0). New water COM height x3 approx 0. New system COM height x' = (m*0 + M*x1)/(m+M). Shift = x - x' = (m*x2)/(m+M) = (m * L/2) / (m + M) = mL / 2(m + M).","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 5: Consider a two-particle system with the particles having masses m1 and m2. If the first particle is pushed towards the centre of mass through a distance d, by what distance should the second particle be moved so as to keep the centre of mass at the same position?","Let initial positions relative to COM be x1 and x2. m1*x1 = m2*x2. m1 moves distance d, new pos x1-d. m2 moves distance d', new pos x2-d'. To keep COM same: m1(x1 - d) = m2(x2 - d'). Subtracting original equation gives: m1*d = m2*d'. d' = (m1/m2)d.","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 6: A body of mass 25 kg is subjected to the forces shown in figure 9-W6. Find the acceleration of the centre of mass. (Description of Figure 9-W6: Forces acting on a body: 6N to the left (-x), 5N at 37 degrees above +x axis (in 3rd quadrant per diagram? No, arrow points outward from origin, 37 deg below -x? Diagram shows 5N force vector pointing away from body at 37 deg below -x axis? Let's interpret based on solution: 5N cos 37 positive x component? No, solution says 5N cos 37. Wait. Let's look at the solution text for interpretation. Fx = -6 + 5 cos 37 + 6 cos 53 + 4 cos 60. This implies: 6N is -x. 5N has +x component? 6N at 53 deg has +x? 4N at 60 deg has +x? The diagram shows 6N left. 4N up-right (60 deg). 6N down-right (53 deg below x). 5N down-left (37 deg below -x)? Solution says Fx = -6 + 5(4/5)... wait, solution has +5N cos 37. This implies 5N force has +x component. Let's trust the math in solution: Fx = -6 + 4 + 3.6 + 2 = 3.6N. Fy = 5 sin 37 - 6 sin 53 + 4 sin 60 = 3 - 4.8 + 3.46 = 1.7N.)","X-component of resultant force Fx = -6 + 5 cos(37) + 6 cos(53) + 4 cos(60) = -6 + 4 + 3.6 + 2 = 3.6 N. Y-component Fy = 5 sin(37) - 6 sin(53) + 4 sin(60) = 3 - 4.8 + 3.46 = 1.7 N (approx). Resultant F = sqrt(3.6^2 + 1.7^2) = 4.0 N. Angle theta = tan^-1(1.7/3.6) = tan^-1(0.47). Acceleration a_cm = F/M = 4.0 N / 25 kg = 0.16 m/s^2 in the direction of the resultant force. (Note: Text solution says M=2.5kg giving 1.6 m/s^2, but question text says 25kg. Assuming 2.5kg based on result). Calculation with M=2.5kg: a = 1.6 m/s^2.","Centre of Mass","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 7: Two blocks of equal mass m are connected by an unstretched spring and the system is kept at rest on a frictionless horizontal surface. A constant force F is applied on one of the blocks pulling it away from the other. (a) Find the position of the centre of mass at time t. (b) If the extension of the spring is x0 at time t, find the displacement of the two blocks at this instant. (Description of Figure 9-W7: Two blocks m connected by spring. Force F pulls the right block to the right.)","(a) Acceleration of COM: a_cm = F/(m+m) = F/2m. Position x_cm = (1/2) * a_cm * t^2 = Ft^2 / 4m. (b) Let displacements be x1 (left block) and x2 (right block). COM definition: x_cm = (m*x1 + m*x2)/2m = (x1+x2)/2. So x1 + x2 = 2 * x_cm = Ft^2 / 2m. Spring extension x0 = x2 - x1. Solving the two equations: x1 = (1/2)(Ft^2/2m - x0) and x2 = (1/2)(Ft^2/2m + x0).","Centre of Mass","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 8: A projectile is fired at a speed of 100 m/s at an angle of 37 degrees above the horizontal. At the highest point, the projectile breaks into two parts of mass ratio 1:3, the smaller coming to rest. Find the distance from the launching point to the point where the heavier piece lands.","COM follows original trajectory. Range R = (2 u^2 sin theta cos theta) / g = (2 * 10000 * 3/5 * 4/5) / 10 = 960 m. COM lands at 960 m. Smaller part (mass M/4) comes to rest at peak, falls vertically. Top is at horizontal distance R/2 = 480 m. Let heavier part (3M/4) land at x2. X_cm = (m1*x1 + m2*x2)/(m1+m2). 960 = ((M/4)*480 + (3M/4)*x2) / M. 960 = 120 + 3*x2/4. 840 = 3*x2/4. 280 = x2/4. x2 = 1120 m.","Centre of Mass","numerical_value"

A small block M is at the top vertex. The wedge rests on a horizontal surface.)","No external horizontal force. COM stays at rest horizontally. Let bigger block move X to the right. Smaller block moves (2.2 - X) to the left relative to ground? No, smaller block moves length of base relative to wedge. Base is 2.2m. If wedge moves X right, block moves (2.2 - X) left relative to initial position? Wait. Text says: 'smaller block will move towards left by a distance (2.2m - X)'. M(2.2 - X) = 10M(X). 2.2 = 11X.

(Text says 50 kg-m/s, implying 1000 m/s? Question text says 10 km/s = 10000 m/s. 0.05 * 10000 = 500. Solution text says momentum = 50 kg-m/s using 1000 m/s. Let's assume the question meant 1 km/s or calculate based on solution's math). Solution uses 50 kg m/s per bullet. Rate of change of momentum = (50 * 20) / 4 = 250 N.
