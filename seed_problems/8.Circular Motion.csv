"Example 7.1: A particle moves in a circle of radius 20 cm with a linear speed of 10 m/s. Find the angular velocity.","The angular velocity is omega = v/r = 10 m/s / 20 cm = 10 m/s / 0.2 m = 50 rad/s.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.2: A particle travels in a circle of radius 20 cm at a speed that uniformly increases. If the speed changes from 5.0 m/s to 6.0 m/s in 2.0 s, find the angular acceleration.","The tangential acceleration is given by a_t = dv/dt = (v2 - v1)/(t2 - t1) = (6.0 - 5.0)/2.0 m/s^2 = 0.5 m/s^2. The angular acceleration is alpha = a_t / r = (0.5 m/s^2) / 20 cm = (0.5 m/s^2) / 0.2 m = 2.5 rad/s^2.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.3: Find the magnitude of the linear acceleration of a particle moving in a circle of radius 10 cm with uniform speed completing the circle in 4 s.","The distance covered in completing the circle is 2*pi*r = 2*pi*10 cm. The linear speed is v = 2*pi*r / t = (2*pi*10 cm) / 4 s = 5*pi cm/s. The linear acceleration is a = v^2 / r = (5*pi cm/s)^2 / 10 cm = 2.5 * pi^2 cm/s^2. This acceleration is directed towards the centre of the circle.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.4: A particle moves in a circle of radius 20 cm. Its linear speed is given by v = 2t, where t is in second and v in metre/second. Find the radial and tangential acceleration at t = 3 s.","The linear speed at t = 3 s is v = 2t = 6 m/s. The radial acceleration at t = 3 s is a_r = v^2 / r = (36 m^2/s^2) / 0.20 m = 180 m/s^2. The tangential acceleration is a_t = dv/dt = d(2t)/dt = 2 m/s^2.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.5: A small block of mass 100 g moves with uniform speed in a horizontal circular groove, with vertical side walls, of radius 25 cm. If the block takes 2.0 s to complete one round, find the normal contact force by the side wall of the groove.","The speed of the block is v = (2*pi * 25 cm) / 2.0 s = 0.785 m/s. The acceleration of the block is a = v^2 / r = (0.785 m/s)^2 / 0.25 m = 2.5 m/s^2 towards the centre. The only force in this direction is the normal contact force due to the side walls. Thus, from Newton's second law, this force is N = ma = (0.100 kg)(2.5 m/s^2) = 0.25 N.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.6: The road at a circular turn of radius 10 m is banked by an angle of 10 degrees. With what speed should a vehicle move on the turn so that the normal contact force is able to provide the necessary centripetal force?","If v is the correct speed, tan theta = v^2 / (rg) or v = sqrt(rg tan theta) = sqrt((10 m)(9.8 m/s^2)(tan 10 degrees)) = 4.2 m/s.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Example 7.7: A body weighs 98 N on a spring balance at the north pole. What will be its weight recorded on the same scale if it is shifted to the equator? Use g = GM/R^2 = 9.8 m/s^2 and the radius of the earth R = 6400 km.","At poles, the apparent weight is same as the true weight. Thus, 98 N = mg = m(9.8 m/s^2), so m = 10 kg. At the equator, the apparent weight is mg' = mg - m(omega^2)R. The radius of the earth is 6400 km and the angular speed is omega = (2*pi rad) / (24*60*60 s) = 7.27 * 10^-5 rad/s. Thus, mg' = 98 N - (10 kg)(7.27 * 10^-5 s^-1)^2(6400 km) = 97.66 N.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 1: A car has to move on a level turn of radius 45 m. If the coefficient of static friction between the tyre and the road is mu_s = 2.0, find the maximum speed the car can take without skidding.","Let the mass of the car be M. The forces on the car are (a) weight Mg downward (b) normal force N by the road upward (c) friction f_s by the road towards the centre. The acceleration is v^2/R towards the centre. Resolving forces: N = Mg and f_s = Mv^2/R. For maximum speed without skidding, friction is limiting: f_s = mu_s * N = mu_s * Mg. So, mu_s * Mg = Mv^2/R => v^2 = mu_s * g * R. Putting values, v = sqrt(2.0 * 10 m/s^2 * 45 m) = 30 m/s = 108 km/hr.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 2: A circular track of radius 600 m is to be designed for cars at an average speed of 180 km/hr. What should be the angle of banking of the track? ","Let the angle of banking be theta. For proper banking, static frictional force is not needed. Vertical acceleration is zero: N cos theta = Mg. Horizontal acceleration is v^2/r towards center: N sin theta = M v^2/r. Dividing equations: tan theta = v^2 / (rg). Putting values: tan theta = (180 km/hr)^2 / (600 m * 10 m/s^2) = (50 m/s)^2 / 6000 = 2500/6000 = 0.4167. theta = 22.6 degrees.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 3: A particle of mass m is suspended from a ceiling through a string of length L. The particle moves in a horizontal circle of radius r. Find (a) the speed of the particle and (b) the tension in the string. Such a system is called a conical pendulum. ","The angle theta made by the string with the vertical is given by sin theta = r/L. Forces on particle: Tension T and weight mg. Radial acceleration is v^2/r. Resolving forces: (ii) T sin theta = m(v^2/r). (iii) T cos theta = mg. Dividing (ii) by (iii): tan theta = v^2 / (rg) => v = sqrt(rg tan theta). From geometry, tan theta = r / sqrt(L^2 - r^2). So v = r * sqrt(g / sqrt(L^2 - r^2)). From (iii), T = mg / cos theta = mgL / sqrt(L^2 - r^2).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 4: One end of a massless spring of spring constant 100 N/m and natural length 0.5 m is fixed and the other end is connected to a particle of mass 0.5 kg lying on a frictionless horizontal table. The spring remains horizontal. If the mass is made to rotate at an angular velocity of 2 rad/s, find the elongation of the spring.","The particle is moving in a horizontal circle, accelerated towards the centre with magnitude v^2/r = omega^2 * r. The horizontal force is due to the spring k*l, where l is elongation. Radius r = l0 + l. Equation: k*l = m * omega^2 * (l0 + l). (k - m * omega^2)l = m * omega^2 * l0. l = (m * omega^2 * l0) / (k - m * omega^2). Putting values: l = (0.5 * 4 * 0.5) / (100 - 0.5 * 4) = 1 / 98 m approx 1 cm.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 5: A simple pendulum is constructed by attaching a bob of mass m to a string of length L fixed at its upper end. The bob oscillates in a vertical circle. It is found that the speed of the bob is v when the string makes an angle theta with the vertical. Find the tension in the string at this instant. ","Forces on the bob are tension T and weight mg. Radial acceleration is v^2/L towards the center O. Component of weight along radius is mg cos theta (away from center). Applying Newton's second law along the radius: T - mg cos theta = m v^2 / L. Thus, T = m(g cos theta + v^2/L).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 6: A cylindrical bucket filled with water is whirled around in a vertical circle of radius r. What can be the minimum speed at the top of the path if water does not fall out from the bucket? If it continues with this speed, what normal contact force the bucket exerts on water at the lowest point of the path? ","At the top, acceleration is v^2/r downward. Forces: Mg down, Normal N down. Mg + N = M v^2/r. For water not to fall, N >= 0, so M v^2/r >= Mg => v^2 >= rg. Minimum speed v = sqrt(rg). If it continues with this speed sqrt(rg), at the bottom: Forces are Mg down, N' up. Acceleration is v^2/r upward. N' - Mg = M v^2/r. N' = M(g + v^2/r) = M(g + rg/r) = 2Mg.","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 7: A fighter plane is pulling out for a dive at a speed of 900 km/hr. Assuming its path to be a vertical circle of radius 2000 m and its mass to be 16000 kg, find the force exerted by the air on it at the lowest point. Take g = 9.8 m/s^2.","At the lowest point, acceleration is v^2/r upward. Forces: Weight Mg down, Force F by air upward. Newton's law: F - Mg = M v^2/r. F = M(g + v^2/r). v = 900 km/hr = 250 m/s. F = 16000(9.8 + 62500/2000) = 6.56 * 10^5 N upward.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 8: A rod of length 20 cm is pivoted near an end and rotates in a horizontal plane with a constant angular speed. A ball of mass m is suspended by a string also of length 20 cm from the other end of the rod. If the angle made by the string with the vertical is 30 degrees, find the angular speed of the rotation. Take g = 10 m/s^2. ","Ball moves in horizontal circle of radius R = L + L sin theta, where L = 20 cm. Acceleration is omega^2 R towards center. Forces: Tension T, weight mg. Vertical: T cos theta = mg. Radial: T sin theta = m * omega^2 * L(1 + sin theta). Dividing equations: tan theta = [omega^2 * L(1 + sin theta)] / g. omega^2 = (g tan theta) / [L(1 + sin theta)]. omega^2 = (10 * tan 30) / [0.20 * (1 + 0.5)] = (5.77) / 0.3 = 19.2. omega = 4.4 rad/s.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 9: Two blocks each of mass M are connected to the ends of a light frame as shown in the figure. The frame is rotated about the vertical line of symmetry. The rod breaks if the tension in it exceeds T0. Find the maximum frequency with which the frame may be rotated without breaking the rod. ","Angular velocity omega = 2*pi*f. Acceleration v^2/l = omega^2 * l = 4*pi^2*f^2*l. Horizontal force is tension. T0 = M * 4*pi^2*f^2*l. f = (1 / 2*pi) * sqrt(T0 / (Ml)).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 10: In a rotor, a hollow vertical cylindrical structure rotates about its axis and a person rests against the inner wall. At a particular speed, the floor is removed and the person hangs resting against the wall. Radius 2 m, coefficient of static friction 0.2. Find the minimum speed at which the floor may be removed. ","Forces: weight mg down, Normal N inward, friction f_s upward. Acceleration v^2/r inward. N = m v^2/r. f_s = mg. Limiting friction f_s = mu_s * N. So mg = mu_s * (m v^2/r). v^2 = rg / mu_s. v = sqrt(2 * 10 / 0.2) = 10 m/s.","Circular Motion","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 11: A hemispherical bowl of radius R is set rotating about its axis of symmetry which is kept vertical. A small block kept in the bowl rotates with the bowl without slipping on its surface. If the surface is smooth, and the angle made by the radius through the block with the vertical is theta, find the angular speed at which the bowl is rotating. ","Block moves in horizontal circle of radius r = R sin theta. Acceleration omega^2 R sin theta towards axis. Forces: Normal N, weight mg. Vertical: N cos theta = mg. Radial: N sin theta = m * omega^2 * R sin theta => N = m * omega^2 * R. Substituting N: m * omega^2 * R * cos theta = mg. omega = sqrt(g / (R cos theta)).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 12: A metal ring of mass m and radius R is placed on a smooth horizontal table and is set rotating about its own axis in such a way that each part of the ring moves with a speed v. Find the tension in the ring. ","Consider small part ACB subtending angle delta theta. Forces: Tensions T at ends acting along tangents. Components towards center: 2T sin(delta theta / 2). This provides centripetal force. Mass of part delta m = (m / 2pi) * delta theta. 2T sin(delta theta / 2) = (m delta theta / 2pi) * (v^2 / R). For small angle, sin(x) approx x. 2T (delta theta / 2) = (m delta theta / 2pi) (v^2 / R). T = (m v^2) / (2pi R).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"

A groove is made on the surface along a radius and a particle is gently placed inside the groove at a distance a from the centre. Find the speed of the particle as its distance from the centre becomes L. ","Work from table frame. Centrifugal force m * omega^2 * x along groove. Acceleration a = omega^2 * x. v dv/dx = omega^2 x. Integral v dv from 0 to v = Integral omega^2 x dx from a to L. v^2 / 2 = omega^2 / 2 * (L^2 - a^2). v = omega * sqrt(L^2 - a^2).","Circular Motion","subjective_detailed_solution"
