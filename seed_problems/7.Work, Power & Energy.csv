"Example 8.1: A spring of spring constant 50 N/m is compressed from its natural position through 1 cm. Find the work done by the spring-force on the agency compressing the spring.","The magnitude of the work is (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2) * (50 N/m) * (1 cm)^2 = (25 N/m) * (1 * 10^-2 m)^2 = 2.5 * 10^-3 J. As the compressed spring will push the agency, the force will be opposite to the displacement of the point of application and the work will be negative. Thus, the work done by the spring-force is -2.5 mJ.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Example 8.2: A particle of mass 20 g is thrown vertically upwards with a speed of 10 m/s. Find the work done by the force of gravity during the time the particle goes up.","Suppose the particle reaches a maximum height h. As the velocity at the highest point is zero, we have 0 = u^2 - 2gh, or, h = u^2 / 2g. The work done by the force of gravity is -mgh = -mg(u^2 / 2g) = -(1/2)mu^2 = -(1/2)(0.02 kg) * (10 m/s)^2 = -1.0 J.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Example 8.3: Two charged particles A and B repel each other by a force k/r^2 where k is a constant and r is the separation between them. The particle A is clamped to a fixed point in the lab and the particle B which has a mass m, is released from rest with an initial separation r0 from A. Find the change in the potential energy of the two-particle system as the separation increases to a large value. What will be the speed of the particle B in this situation? ","Take A + B as the system. The only external force acting on the system is that needed to hold A fixed. This force does no work because it acts on charge A which does not move. Thus, the external forces do no work and internal forces are conservative. The total mechanical energy must remain constant. There are two internal forces; F_AB acting on A and F_BA acting on B. The force F_AB does no work because it acts on A which does not move. The work done by F_BA as particle B is taken away is W = Integral from r0 to infinity of (k/r^2)dr = k/r0. The change in potential energy of the system is U_f - U_i = -W = -k/r0. As the total mechanical energy is conserved, K_f + U_f = K_i + U_i. K_f = K_i - (U_f - U_i). Since K_i = 0, K_f = k/r0. Or, (1/2)mv^2 = k/r0. Thus, v = sqrt(2k / mr0).","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 8.4: A block of mass m slides along a frictionless surface as shown in the figure. If it is released from rest at A, what is its speed at B? ","Take the block + the earth as the system. Only the block moves, so only the work done on the block will contribute to the gravitational potential energy. As it descends through a height h between A and B, the potential energy decreases by mgh. The normal contact force N on the block by the surface does no work as it is perpendicular to its velocity. No external force does any work on the system. Hence, increase in kinetic energy = decrease in potential energy. (1/2)mv^2 = mgh or, v = sqrt(2gh).","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 8.5: A pendulum bob has a speed 3 m/s while passing through its lowest position. What is its speed when it makes an angle of 60 degrees with the vertical? The length of the pendulum is 0.5 m. Take g = 10 m/s^2. ","Take the bob + earth as the system. The external force acting on the system is that due to the string. But this force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the bob and so the work done by this force is zero. Hence, the total mechanical energy will remain constant. The height ascended by the bob at an angular displacement theta is l - l cos theta = l(1 - cos theta). The increase in potential energy is mgl(1 - cos theta). This should be equal to the decrease in the kinetic energy of the system. If the speed at an angular displacement is v1, the decrease in kinetic energy is (1/2)mv0^2 - (1/2)mv1^2, where v0 is the speed at the lowest position. Thus, (1/2)mv0^2 - (1/2)mv1^2 = mgl(1 - cos theta). or, v1 = sqrt(v0^2 - 2gl(1 - cos theta)). Substituting values: v1 = sqrt((9 m^2/s^2) - 2 * (10 m/s^2) * (0.5 m) * (1 - 1/2)) = 2 m/s.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Example 8.6: A block of mass m, attached to a spring of spring constant k, oscillates on a smooth horizontal table. The other end of the spring is fixed to a wall. If it has a speed v when the spring is at its natural length, how far will it move on the table before coming to an instantaneous rest?","Consider the block + the spring as the system. The external forces acting on the system are (a) the force of gravity, (b) the normal force by the table and (c) the force by the wall. None of these do any work on this system and hence the total mechanical energy is conserved. If the block moves a distance x before coming to rest, we have (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)kx^2. or, x = v * sqrt(m/k).","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Example 8.7: A block of mass m is suspended through a spring of spring constant k and is in equilibrium. A sharp blow gives the block an initial downward velocity v. How far below the equilibrium position, the block comes to an instantaneous rest? ","Consider the block + the spring + the earth as the system. When the block is in equilibrium, mg = kx, so the spring is stretched by x = mg/k. Take gravitational potential energy to be zero in this position. The total mechanical energy just after the blow is (1/2)mv^2 + (1/2)k(mg/k)^2 = (1/2)mv^2 + (m^2 g^2) / 2k. If the block descends height h before stopping, elastic potential energy becomes (1/2)k(mg/k + h)^2 and gravitational potential energy becomes -mgh. Kinetic energy is zero. Thus: (1/2)mv^2 + (m^2 g^2)/2k = (1/2)k(mg/k + h)^2 - mgh. Solving this gives h = v * sqrt(m/k).","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 1: A porter lifts a suitcase weighing 20 kg from the platform and puts it on his head 2.0 m above the platform. Calculate the work done by the porter on the suitcase.","The kinetic energy of the suitcase was zero when it was at the platform and it again became zero when it was put on the head. The change in kinetic energy is zero and hence the total work done on the suitcase is zero. Two forces act on the suitcase, one due to gravity and the other due to the porter. Thus, the work done by the porter is negative of the work done by gravity. As the suitcase is lifted up, the work done by gravity is W = -mgh = -(20 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(2 m) = -392 J. The work done by the porter is 392 J approx 390 J.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 2: An elevator weighing 500 kg is to be lifted up at a constant velocity of 0.20 m/s. What would be the minimum horsepower of the motor to be used?","As the elevator is going up with a uniform velocity, the total work done on it is zero in any time interval. The work done by the motor is equal to the work done by the force of gravity in that interval (in magnitude). The power delivered is P = Fv = mgv = (500 kg)(9.8 m/s^2)(0.2 m/s) = 980 W. Minimum horsepower P = 980 W = 980/746 hp = 1.3 hp.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 3: A block of mass 2.0 kg is pulled up on a smooth incline of angle 30 degrees with the horizontal. If the block moves with an acceleration of 1.0 m/s^2, find the power delivered by the pulling force at a time 4.0 s after the motion starts. What is the average power delivered during the 4.0 s after the motion starts? ","Forces on the block are F (pulling), mg sin 30 (down slope), N (normal). Resolving parallel to incline: F - mg sin theta = ma. F = mg sin theta + ma = (2.0 kg)[(9.8 m/s^2)(0.5) + 1.0 m/s^2] = 11.8 N. Velocity at t = 4.0 s is v = at = (1.0 m/s^2)(4.0 s) = 4.0 m/s. Power at t = 4.0 s is P = F * v = (11.8 N)(4.0 m/s) approx 47 W. Displacement in 4s is x = (1/2)at^2 = (1/2)(1.0)(16) = 8.0 m. Work done W = F * d = (11.8 N)(8.0 m) = 94.4 J.

Find the work done by this force during a displacement from x = 0 to x = 2.0 m.","As the force is variable, work is integral of F dx. W = Integral from 0 to 2.0 of (10 + 0.50x) dx = [10x + 0.50(x^2/2)] from 0 to 2.0 = [10(2) + 0.25(4)] - 0 = 20 + 1 = 21 J.","Work, Power & Energy","numerical_value"
"Worked Out Example 5: A body dropped from a height H reaches the ground with a speed of 1.2 * sqrt(gH). Calculate the work done by air-friction.","By work-energy theorem, total work done is Change in KE. W_total = (1/2)m(1.2 * sqrt(gH))^2 - 0 = 0.72 mgH. Total work W_total = W_gravity + W_friction. W_gravity = mgH. Thus, 0.72 mgH = mgH + W_friction. W_friction = 0.72 mgH - mgH = -0.28 mgH.","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 6: A block of mass M is pulled along a horizontal surface by applying a force at an angle theta with the horizontal. The friction coefficient between the block and the surface is mu. If the block travels at a uniform velocity, find the work done by this applied force during a displacement d of the block. ","Forces: Mg down, N up, F at angle theta, friction f back. Horizontal balance: F cos theta = mu * N. Vertical balance: F sin theta + N = Mg. Eliminating N: F cos theta = mu(Mg - F sin theta). F(cos theta + mu sin theta) = mu Mg. F = (mu Mg) / (cos theta + mu sin theta).

"Worked Out Example 7: Two cylindrical vessels of equal cross-sectional area A contain water upto heights h1 and h2. The vessels are interconnected so that the levels in them become equal. Calculate the work done by the force of gravity during the process. The density of water is rho. ","Since total volume is constant, final height is (h1 + h2)/2. Effectively, water from height h1 down to (h1+h2)/2 has moved to the other vessel raising it from h2 to (h1+h2)/2. The mass of this water is m = rho * A * (h1 - (h1+h2)/2) = rho * A * (h1 - h2)/2. The height descended by this center of mass of water is AC = (h1 - h2)/2. Work done by gravity = mgh = [rho * A * (h1 - h2)/2] * g * [(h1 - h2)/2] = rho * A * g * ((h1 - h2)/2)^2.","Work, Power & Energy","subjective_detailed_solution"
"Worked Out Example 8: What minimum horizontal speed should be given to the bob of a simple pendulum of length l so that it describes a complete circle? ","Let speed at bottom be v0 and at top be v. Conservation of energy: (1/2)mv0^2 = (1/2)mv^2 + 2mgl. So mv^2 = mv0^2 - 4mgl. Forces at top: mg + T = mv^2/l. Substituting mv^2: mg + T = (1/l)(mv0^2 - 4mgl). mv0^2 = 5mgl + Tl.

"Worked Out Example 9: A uniform chain of length l and mass m overhangs a smooth table with its two third part lying on the table. Find the kinetic energy of the chain as it completely slips off the table. ","Take zero potential energy at the table. Consider a part dx at depth x. Potential energy dU = -(m/l dx)gx. Total PE of hanging part (length l/3) is Integral from 0 to l/3 of -(m/l)gx dx = -mgl/18. PE when completely slipped off (length l hanging) is Integral from 0 to l of -(m/l)gx dx = -mgl/2.

"Worked Out Example 10: A block of mass m is pushed against a spring of spring constant k fixed at one end to a wall. The block can slide on a frictionless table. The natural length of the spring is L0 and it is compressed to half its natural length when the block is released. Find the velocity of the block as a function of its distance x from the wall. ","Initial compression is L0/2. When distance from wall is x (where x < L0), compression is L0 - x. Conservation of energy: (1/2)k(L0/2)^2 = (1/2)k(L0 - x)^2 + (1/2)mv^2. Solving for v: v = sqrt(k/m) * sqrt(L0^2/4 - (L0 - x)^2). When spring acquires natural length (x=L0), v = sqrt(k/m) * L0/2.

Neglect friction. ","Let speed at top of loop be v. Start height from platform relative to top of loop is h. Conservation of energy: mgh = (1/2)mv^2. So mv^2 = 2mgh.

"Worked Out Example 14: A heavy particle is suspended by a string of length l. The particle is given a horizontal velocity v0. The string becomes slack at some angle and the particle proceeds on a parabola. Find the value of v0 if the particle passes through the point of suspension. ","String becomes slack at angle theta with vertical. Radial force balance: mg cos theta = mv^2/l => v^2 = gl cos theta. Conservation of energy from bottom to slack point: (1/2)mv0^2 = (1/2)mv^2 + mgl(1 + cos theta). Substituting v^2: v0^2 = gl(2 + 3 cos theta). From slack point, particle follows parabola. Passing through origin equations: Horizontal: l sin theta = (v cos theta)t. Vertical: -l cos theta = (v sin theta)t - (1/2)gt^2. Eliminating t leads to: cos^2 theta = sin^2 theta - (1/2)g(l^2 sin^2 theta)/(v^2 cos^2 theta). Substituting v^2 = gl cos theta simplifies to 1 = (1/2) tan^2 theta, so tan theta = sqrt(2).
